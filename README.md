# creamteaSimpleGeantSim

The creamteaSimpleGeantSim library is one of a number of software packages that are required for the simulation and analysis of CREAM TEA data. The three main packages are:

creamteaSimpleGeantSim:: The GEANT code that actually simulates the output of the scintillator

creamteaPcaCode:: The code that calculates the Point of Closest approach for tracks in the upper and lower detectors

creamteaImageProcessing:: Takes the output of pcaCode and makes it more human friendly (originally based on routines by Sam Cook)

All of these packages now live in GitHub:
